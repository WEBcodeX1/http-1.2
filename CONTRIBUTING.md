## How to contribute to HTTP/1.2

Basically:

1. Clone repository

### Clean Code

I am a big fan of the clean code paradigm. So you should:

1. Blame non-clean-code
2. Code with the clean code paradigm in mind

### Signing Key / pkcs11

It is adviced to add a public signing key to GitHub and use Smartcards with openssh / ssh-agent.

Details about configuration see: [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification).
